- 👋 Hi, I’m Shubhasmita
- 👀 I’m interested in the wild west of Artificial Intelligence
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 📚 I'm a college student, pursuing Electronics and Communication Engg, with a specialization in AI
- ☘️ Tid Bit : I've developed plant-o-mania over lockdown... I hope to channelise this into developing a watering system for when I am out of station in summer, well next one, hopefully (PANDEMIC mode still on 😷)
- 💭 Another random bit : My username has nothing to do with the Operating System . It is supposed to mean 'android' as in a 'bot'.  
(PS. I haven't worked on anything remotely Android in the 2 decades of my existance. Uncanny and ironic? 🤷)
- 📫 How to reach me ...
