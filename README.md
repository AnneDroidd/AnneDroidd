# 👋 Hi, I'm Shubhasmita (AnneDroidd)

🎓 Master's Student in Artificial Intelligence @ FAU Erlangen–Nürnberg, Germany  
🤖 Passionate about **Reinforcement Learning, Explainable AI, and Applied Machine Learning**  
💡 Exploring the wild west of AI — from interpretability to intelligent agents  

---

## 🔭 Current Work
### 🧠 Explaining Deep Models with SHAP & Captum
Mini-project inspired by [Decoding Foundation Models – Enhancing Understanding and Transparency](https://www.mad.tf.fau.de/2024/07/23/id-2418-decoding-foundation-models-enhancing-understanding-and-transparency/)

- 🗂 **Tabular Data**: Apply SHAP to interpret XGBoost predictions  
- 📝 **Text**: Use SHAP + HuggingFace BERT for NLP model explanations  
- 🖼 **Vision**: Apply Captum’s Integrated Gradients to ResNet18 for image interpretability  
- 🔎 **Transformers**: Visualize BERT attention heads to study interpretability  
- 📊 Goal: Demonstrate transparency across **tabular, text, and vision** modalities  
- 📓 Preparing **Jupyter notebooks** to share as an open resource on GitHub  

### 🎮 Reinforcement Learning
- Building and experimenting with RL agents (Q-learning, Policy Gradients, Actor–Critic)  
- Exploring applications of RL in real-world systems and lightweight environments  
- Designing reproducible **RL experiment notebooks** for learning and research  

---

## 📂 Featured Projects
- [Hierarchical Clustering](https://github.com/AnneDroidd/HierarchicalClustering) – From scratch clustering implementation with visualization  
- *(Coming soon: “Explainable AI with SHAP & Captum” – notebooks across tabular, text, and vision)*  
- *(RL experiments repository – documenting agents, environments, and results)*
